  Working with Juan Miguel has been an exceptional experience. His charisma, collaborative spirit, and deep technical expertise made him an invaluable part of our team. He consistently brought clarity and insight to complex challenges, and his ability to connect with others created a positive and motivating environment for everyone around him.
